What does it say next to Units? It says "sectors of 1 * 512 = 512"

How big is each sector? It's 512 bytes big

What are the start blocks for the partitions? The start blocks are 8192 and 
122880

4194204 for first
62914560 for second

I see files in the first partitian and the linux system in the second with 
directories like user.
